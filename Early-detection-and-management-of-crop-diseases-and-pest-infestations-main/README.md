## 🎯 Problem Statement

Plant diseases can significantly affect crop health and agricultural productivity,
especially when symptoms are not identified at an early stage. Farmers may not
always have immediate access to agricultural experts for identifying diseases
from visible symptoms.

LeafLens AI aims to provide a fast and accessible preliminary plant-health
assessment using leaf images. By combining computer vision, leaf localization
and segmentation, and deep-learning-based disease classification, the system
helps users identify potential plant diseases and understand the recommended
care and preventive measures.

The goal is to make AI-assisted plant disease identification more accessible,
while keeping the system simple enough to be used through a web interface.


## 📌 Overview

**LeafLens AI** is an AI-powered plant health and disease detection system that analyzes leaf images using **deep learning and computer vision**.

The project combines a **Next.js frontend** with a **FastAPI machine-learning backend**. An uploaded image passes through an image localization and segmentation pipeline before being classified by an **ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNetB0** model.

The current classifier supports **38 plant disease and healthy classes** and returns the predicted condition, confidence score, and top-3 predictions.

The frontend also supports **multilingual localization**, allowing the user interface and disease information to be presented in multiple languages while keeping the ML backend language-independent and English-based.

## ✨ Features

### 🌿 AI Plant Disease Detection

- Image-based plant disease detection.
- EfficientNetB0-based image classification.
- 38 disease and healthy classes.
- Prediction confidence score.
- Top-3 predictions with confidence values.
- Disease-specific information including symptoms, causes, prevention, and treatment/care.

### 🎯 Image Localization & Segmentation

The image-processing pipeline includes **leaf localization and segmentation** before classification.

```text
Input Image
     ↓
Leaf Localization
     ↓
Leaf Segmentation
     ↓
Relevant Leaf Region
     ↓
Disease Classification
```

This helps reduce the influence of irrelevant background information and allows the classifier to focus on the plant leaf.

```

### Training Strategy

The model is trained in two stages.

**Phase 1 — Feature Extraction**

The pretrained EfficientNetB0 backbone is frozen while the classification head learns the plant disease classes.

**Phase 2 — Fine-Tuning**

Later layers of EfficientNetB0 are unfrozen and trained with a smaller learning rate so that pretrained features can adapt to plant disease patterns.

## 📊 Model Output

The model returns the predicted disease, confidence, and top-3 predictions.

Example:

```json
{
  "disease": "Tomato___Early_blight",
  "confidence": 98.42,
  "top_predictions": [
    {
      "disease": "Tomato___Early_blight",
      "confidence": 98.42
    },
    {
      "disease": "Tomato___Late_blight",
      "confidence": 0.91
    },
    {
      "disease": "Tomato___Leaf_Mold",
      "confidence": 0.31
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🔌 API

### `POST /predict`

Accepts a plant leaf image using `multipart/form-data` and returns a structured prediction.

### Request

```text
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file = <leaf image>
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "leaf.jpg",
  "disease": "Tomato___Early_blight",
  "confidence": 98.42,
  "top_predictions": [
    {
      "disease": "Tomato___Early_blight",
      "confidence": 98.42
    }
  ]
}
```

The current prototype provides:

- ✅ End-to-end image upload
- ✅ Next.js frontend
- ✅ FastAPI backend
- ✅ Leaf localization
- ✅ Leaf segmentation
- ✅ EfficientNetB0 classification
- ✅ 38 disease/healthy classes

The current validation accuracy is approximately **98.07%** on the current validation dataset.

> **Note:** Validation accuracy does not guarantee the same performance on real-world images. Complex backgrounds, unusual lighting, blur, multiple leaves, and other uncontrolled conditions can affect predictions. A high softmax confidence score also does not necessarily guarantee that a prediction is correct.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Upload** — The user uploads an image of a plant leaf.
2. **Localization** — The relevant leaf region is identified.
3. **Segmentation** — The leaf is isolated from irrelevant background regions.
4. **Preprocessing** — The image is converted and resized for model inference.
5. **Classification** — EfficientNetB0 predicts the plant's health condition.
6. **Ranking** — The system generates the top-3 predictions and confidence scores.
7. **Presentation** — Disease information is displayed in the user's selected language.
